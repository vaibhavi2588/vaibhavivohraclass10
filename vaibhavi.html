	<h3> <p> Dharamshala is Tibetan place </p> 
		<p> On 27th of June 2023 I reached Dharamshala through air and I as soon as stepped out the of the airport I feel like I was standing in the center of a paradise, the place was full of trees, different species of birds, colourful flowers. I would say that god took time to design this place not going got lie but the place was very aesthetic, as soon as reached my hotel which was located in norbolingko the owner of hotel had their personal garden which was very charming, the lush green grass was moving with the wind, two baby ducklings was sleeping on their bed the seen was very peaceful, I can clearly see the Himalayan ranges from the hotel, the farmers were doing terrace farming on the land which was beside our hotel, After exploring the hotel I decided to took a nap after a long exertion, me and my family enjoyed the Tibetan culture of Dharamshala in three days like enjoying Tibetan and Korean food as I am fond of these food. I buy many bracelets of real stone such as Quartz. I meet my family friends who were living in Dharamshala . </p> </h3>
<h4>
<p>HISTORY OF DHARAMSHALA:- Historically, the Kangra valley was part of the ancient Trigarth region that extended from the plains of Punjab to the hills of Himachal. It was ruled by the Katoch dynasty until the British invaded in 1810. In the year 1860, the 66th Gurkha light infantry moved to the site of an old rest house at the seat of Dhauladhar ranges known in local parlance as Dharamshala and converted it into a subsidiary cantonment. This soon grew into a cluster of 14 Gurkha platoon villages, and the battalion later became the 1st Gurkha Rifles. The town of Dharamshala was thus established. In 1959, thousands of Tibetans, along with their leader His Holiness Dalai Lama, fled their homeland due to Chinese invasion and atrocity. They were given refuge in India, and resettled in the upper reaches of Dharamshala that has eventually come to be known as McLeodganj. Over the years, several Tibetans have settled here, establishing schools, monasteries, and temples. The cantonment still exists in Dharamshala, coexisting with the Tibetan settlement and the local pastoral Gaddi tribe villages.</p>
